These Schematron rules are part of the OGC(c) Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) standard, conformance class "gml-coverage".
They provide additional conformance checks on coverage instance documents encloded in XML, beyond the capabilities of XML Schema. However, this does not capture all conformance checks established in the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) of CIS; these additional checks are implemented directly in CTL (Conformance Test Language) of the OGC TEAM Engine on which the overall conformance test is implemented.
