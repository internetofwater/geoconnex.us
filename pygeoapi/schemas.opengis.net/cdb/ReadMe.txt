OGC(r) Common Database Standard (CDB)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Common Database (CDB) Standard specifies an open format and
encoding for the storage, access and modification of a representation
of the natural and built environment for simulation applications. CDB
defines the data representation, organization and storage structure of
a worldwide synthetic representation of the earth as well as the
conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems of a
full-mission simulator.
