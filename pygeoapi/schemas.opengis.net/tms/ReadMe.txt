OGC(r) TileMatrixSet schema ReadMe.txt
==================================

OGC(r) TileMatrixSet (tms)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TileMatrixSet specifies the concept of a tile matrix set and tile matrix set
limits and its implementation in 2D space. This standard also provides both a
XML and a JSON encoding. The Tile Matrix Set concept, initially developed in
OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0, is now provided as an independent standard
that can be referenced by other standards such as WMTS 2.0 and GeoPackage, or
the NRCan promoted standard candidate Map Markup Language (MapML). In addition,
we ensure that the tile matrix set concept can be used by grid based tiles as
well as for vector tiles.
