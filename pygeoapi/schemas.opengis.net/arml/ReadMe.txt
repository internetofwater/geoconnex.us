==================================

OGC(r) Augmented Reality Markup Language Standard (ARML)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This OGC Standard defines the Augmented Reality Markup Language (ARML).
ARML allows users to describe virtual objects in an Augmented Reality (AR)
scene with their appearances and their anchors (a broader concept of a
location) related to the real world. Additionally, ARML defines ECMAScript
bindings to dynamically modify the AR scene based on user behavior and user
input.
