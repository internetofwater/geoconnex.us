Meta Redirect
====================

This is Yourls plugin use to skip spam check.
in my case. i can't post [ok-like.net](https://ok-like.net) url to facebook because facebook report this is spam, after i shorten link facebook report it spam too. so i this plugin use tag meta to redirect it will skip facebook spam check. if you want to redirect with tag meta add "_" (under score) before your keyword. if not it will use header redirect as default.

such as [example.com/30v](http://example.com/30v) will change to [example.com/_30v](http://kuy.me/30v)

How to
===================
* In /user/plugins, create a new folder named meta-redirect
* Drop these files in that directory
* Go to the Plugins administration page and activate the plugin
* Have fun
