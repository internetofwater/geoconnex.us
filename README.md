The Geoconnex project provides both **technical infrastructure and guidance** for implementing an open, community-contribution model for a knowledge graph linking hydrologic features in the United States, published in accordance with [Spatial Data on the Web best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/) as an implementation of [Internet of Water](https://github.com/opengeospatial/SELFIE/blob/master/docs/demo/internet_of_water.md) principles.

In short, Geoconnex aims to make water data as easily discoverable, accessible, and usable as possible.

## About this Repository

Geoconnex is a project made up of multiple system components. In order to make contribution to Geoconnex simpler, this repository contains **just the registry** for persistent identifiers for hydrologic features.

Other code repositories that contributors may not need to directly interact with and are internal Geoconnex infrastructure can be found on the [Geoconnex Code Repositories](https://docs.geoconnex.us/about/system-architecture/repositories) page and are located in the [Internet of Water Github Organization](https://github.com/internetofwater).
