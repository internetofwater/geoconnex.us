# Permanent Identifiers (PIDs) for US Hydrologic Features
================================================

This is the registry for PIDs with the base https://geoconnex.us, principally to assign permanent identifiers and redirects for hydrologic and other spatial features in the United States as an implementation of [Internet of Water](https://github.com/opengeospatial/SELFIE/blob/master/docs/demo/internet_of_water.md) principles. Persistent identifiers are important for maintaining a production system of linked environmental data systems, of the sort that [SELFIE](https://github.com/opengeospatial/SELFIE) experimented, in order to reduce the problem of broken links when data publishers change URLs and maintain the integrity of search indexes built by web crawlers.

The geoconnex.us project is intentionally incremental -- seeking to build useful capabilities incrementally as we scale up adoption and capabilities.

The registry contains three kinds of spatial features. The distinctions between these are not strong -- some sets of features may function as more than one type.

1. community reference features: monitoring and environmental features collated by a person or group in the interest of the community
1. organizational features: features owned by a particular organizational entity
1. cataloging features: features used to catalog data that are not monitoring or directly observable environmental features.

These are all registered in the [namespaces](namespaces) folder. Namespaces contains organizations, datasets, and a special `https://geoconnex.us/ref` namespace reserved for community reference and cataloging features not owned by a single organization.
