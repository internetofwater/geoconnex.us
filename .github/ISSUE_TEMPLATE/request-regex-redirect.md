### Link to sitemap or file to create one.
Ideally, a list of URIs that can be accessed via the newly created redirect is available such that a crawler can index the source content. This could be in xml, csv, or geojson. If in xml, the sitemap.xml format is immediately useful. If in csv or geojson, a field in the file should contain the geoconnus.us URIs or information needed to construct the URIs. This is not strictly required, but if the source is to be crawled in whole, it is needed.
