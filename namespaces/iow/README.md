These mappings are of two kinds:

1. temporary, experimental resources hosted by the Internet of Water organization for the purposes of testing geoconnex.us infrastructure. 
2. (meta)data resources curated directly by the Internet of Water organization. 

This collection will evolve over time, with experimental PIDs being retired as appropriate.
