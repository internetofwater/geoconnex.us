# Water Quality Portal (WQP) Stations

WQP station identifiers are based on the Water Quality Portal (WQP) monitoring locations and are hosted as a SensorThings API. These identifiers redirect to a landing page that provides a hydrographic address referencing NHDPlusV2, an associated mainstem URI, and a link to the original WQP dataset for the station.
