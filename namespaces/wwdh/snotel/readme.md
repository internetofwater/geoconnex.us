USDA Snow Telemetry Network (SNOTEL)
===

These mappings are for all SNOTEL sites. These contain only sites which are active and not out of service. It uses the same API endpoint as the AWDB Forecasts namespace but returns only active historical timeseries data, not future forecasts.

All redirects are 1:1 and directly map the PID to the monitoring location ID. 

Example:
* `https://geoconnex.us/wwdh/snotel/301` -> `https://api.wwdh.internetofwater.app/collections/snotel-edr/items/301`
