AWDB (Air and Water Database) Forecasts
===

These mappings represent all stations in the AWDB (Air and Water Database) API that contain forecast data. Although this uses the same API as the Snotel collection in Geoconnex, it contains data from many organizations and not just snotel. As such, each item id is identified with the native station triplet code that is used to identify the station in the upstream API.
