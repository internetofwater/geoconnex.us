NOAA River Forecast Center
===

These mappings are for the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) River Forecast Center. This source aggregates multiple regional river forecast centers into a single collection. There is not natively a single API for this data. Rather we reverse engineer the frontend code [here](https://www.cbrfc.noaa.gov/wsup/graph/west/map/esp_map.js) which compromises [this map](https://www.cbrfc.noaa.gov/wsup/graph/west/map/esp_map.html)
