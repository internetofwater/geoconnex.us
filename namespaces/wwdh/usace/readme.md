USACE Access to Water 
===

These mappings are for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Access to Water API. This API is a subset of the general CWMS API from USACE and provides info on dams and reservoirs in the US. All of the sites in the API are included. Additional metadata about the dams not present in the upstream API such as 30 year averages are appended to the feature properties for richer contextual info.

All redirects are 1:1 and directly map the PID to the monitoring location ID in Access to Water.
