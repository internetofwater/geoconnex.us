# geoconnex.us/ref features

This is a community identifier namespace. It is to be used for shared identifiers for thematic collections of features.

PIDs in this namespace will follow the pattern:
`/ref/{featuretype}/{id}`

Where {featuretype} is the thematic type. 

Expected types are:  
- hu02
- hu04
- hu06
- hu08
- dams
- gages
- wells
- principle-aquifers
- mainstems

Each reference feature type should either be an established set of persistent features or be created through a community process that is intended to integrate all available sources of relevant features into a community reference collection.

Long term, landing-content for these features will contain a preview of the feature, links to related features, and links to known representations or otherwise related data. Progress toward this goal will be intentionally incremental -- landing-content should be expected to change over time.
