This is a reference collection of U.S. Places (incorporated municipalities and unincorporated Census Designated Places (CDP)) as described by the Profile web pages from the U.S. Census Center for Enterprise Dissemination Services and Consumer Innovation (CEDSCI) at [https://data.census.gov/cedsci](https://data.census.gov/cedsci). 

The current implementation creating these ids and landing-content is in: https://github.com/ksonda/geoconnex_prep/tree/master/census and hosted on https://info.geoconnex.us/collections/counties. GeoPackage source for the landing content is available in [hydroshare.](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4a22e88e689949afa1cf71ae009eaf1b/data/contents/places.gpkg) All data were derived from the current [U.S. Census current Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html), which are simplified for web viewing and not meant for geospatial analysis.

Example:

The PIDs are derived from the U.S. Census GEOID, which is itself derived from FIPS codes.
