This is a reference collection of mainstem rivers. These features should be considered community cataloging features and can be referenced as such.

These features are defined by a headwater and outlet pair and generally adhere
 to the upstream-mainstem topology of the NHDPlusV2.

The current implementation creating these ids and landing-content is in: https://code.usgs.gov/wma/nhgf/mainstems and https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs/geoconnex_prep. The gpkg for this is hosted on https://reference.geoconnex.us/collections/mainstems. The geopackage source for the landing content is available [here.](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4a22e88e689949afa1cf71ae009eaf1b/data/contents/mainstems.gpkg)
