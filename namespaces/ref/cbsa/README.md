This is a reference collection of Core Based Statistical Areas as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (https://www.census.gov/topics/housing/housing-patterns/about/core-based-statistical-areas.html).

The current implementation creating these ids and landing-content is in: https://github.com/ksonda/geoconnex_prep/tree/master/census and hosted on https://reference.geoconnex.us/collections/aiannh. GeoPackage source for the landing content is available in [hydroshare.](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/3295a17b4cc24d34bd6a5c5aaf753c50/data/contents/cbsa.gpkg).  Geographic boundaries are optimized for web viewing as produced by the [U.S. Census current Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html), and are not meant for use in geospatial analysis.

Example:

The PIDs are derived from the U.S. Census GEOID, which is itself derived from FIPS codes.
