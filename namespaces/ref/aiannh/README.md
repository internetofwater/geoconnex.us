This is a reference collection of American Indian/Alaska Native Areas/Hawaiian Home Lands as defined by Bureau of Indian Affairs and Delineated by the U.S. Census Boundary and Annexation Survey. 

The current implementation creating these ids and landing-content is in: https://github.com/ksonda/geoconnex_prep/tree/master/census and hosted on https://reference.geoconnex.us/collections/aiannh. GeoPackage source for the landing content is available in [hydroshare.](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4a22e88e689949afa1cf71ae009eaf1b/data/contents/aiannh.gpkg). Geographic boundaries are optimized for web viewing as produced by the [U.S. Census current Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html)

Example:

The PIDs are derived from the U.S. Census GEOID, which is itself derived from FIPS codes.
