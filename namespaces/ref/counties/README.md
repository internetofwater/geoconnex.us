This is a reference collection of U.S. Counties as described by the Profile web pages from the U.S. Census Center for Enterprise Dissemination Services and Consumer Innovation (CEDSCI) at [https://data.census.gov/cedsci](https://data.census.gov/cedsci). 

The current implementation creating these ids and landing-content is in: https://github.com/ksonda/geoconnex_prep/tree/master/census and hosted on https://reference.geoconnex.us/collections/counties. GeoPackage source for the landing content is available in [hydroshare.](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/3295a17b4cc24d34bd6a5c5aaf753c50/data/contents/counties.gpkg) All data were derived from the current [U.S. Census current Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html), which are simplified for web viewing and not meant for geospatial analysis.


Example:

The PIDs are derived from the U.S. Census GEOID, which is itself derived from FIPS codes.
